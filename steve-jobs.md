Steve Jobs introduced the Apple I in 1976, and it was one of the first personal computers to come as a fully assembled circuit board. The Apple II followed a year after, and it featured color graphics, pre-installed software, etc. Steve Jobs created a more user-friendly computing experience with the Macintosh in 1984; it was the first successful personal computer to feature a graphical user interface (GUI) with a built-in screen and mouse.

Peer review: Could you add more details about the first Macintosh computer?
